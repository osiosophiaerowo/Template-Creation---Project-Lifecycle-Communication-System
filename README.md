This repository showcases a structured client communication lifecycle system built using Gmail templates. The system standardizes interactions across all project stages — from inquiry and onboarding to project delivery and invoice follow-up — improving workflow clarity, consistency, and executive efficiency.

# Client Communication Lifecycle System (Gmail Templates)
**Executive Assistant Portfolio Project**

## Project Overview

While working as an Executive Assistant at Apex Design Studio, I designed and implemented a structured Gmail template system that supported the full client journey — from initial inquiry to project completion and payment follow-up.

Instead of handling emails reactively, I created a standardized communication lifecycle that improved efficiency, maintained brand consistency, and streamlined project management.
